# Record the process of learning Apple Dev

## Swift Basic
I first watch the video of "CodeWithChris" on Youtube named "Swift Tutorial for Beginner". There, I learned:
- Variable
- If and For
- Function
- Class 

## UIKit


## SwiftUI 

From Chirs course, I personally build a easy app, and I learned:

- Text
- Stack
- Image
- Button
- SF symbols

Those are pretty basic, but it is pretty easy and useful for the future learning.
